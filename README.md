#The solution to your Instagram scrolling addiction
I've struggled with Instagram scrolling in the past. To combat this I stopped using Instagram or severely limited my time on the app. 
Now I only use it for messaging but from time to time I like to check reels to get a laugh or see the latest trends.
The problem is I still often spend more time then I intend to just like before. This is the rationale for making this bot. Now I'm more cognisant of my time being spent on Instagram and the posts from this bot will serve as a reminder to stop scrolling and exit the app.
